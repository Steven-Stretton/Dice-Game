'a.k.a Pig'

GAME RULES:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they whish. Each dice roll gets added to their ROUND score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, their entire ROUND score gets wiped. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND score gets added and saved to their GLOBAL score. Before passing their turn to the opponent. 
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
